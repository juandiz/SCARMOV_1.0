# SCARMOV_1.0
Proyecto TFG

The following work includes the complete development of a SCARA robot with the 
possibility of numerous clamping applications. In this sense, the main objective is to achieve a 
design that allows the change of actuators in a simple way, both at the Hardware and Software 
level and that has the possibility of being applied in multiple industrial applications. 

For this purpose, an investigation of the current works carried out in the area is made to 
have a starting point from which the development will begin. Then the concepts and mathematics 
involved in the control process for the implementation of the SW and HW of the application will 
be evaluated. In addition, the investigation of the SG is included as one of the possible types of 
actuators that can be integrated with the main robot so that clamping tasks of ellipsoidal objects 
with pressure control can be executed. Also, see the production process of the entire robot body 
by using FDM and laser cutting technologies. Afterwards, a study of the SW architecture and its 
implementation will be made with the use of high-level programming languages, such as Python, 
and low-level ones, such as C and C++. For this, 2 application modules were developed that were 
connected using IP/UDP communication. Finally, a simulation is assembled in which the SCARA 
is tested being used as the main actuator of a mobile robot.
 
This work aims to establish the pillars of a FWR that has all the necessary requirements so 
that a user can, from a simple HMI, control and monitor a SCARA robot through WiFi. In this way, 
there is a starting point for larger projects about control, automation and IoT.
